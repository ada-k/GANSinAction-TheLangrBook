### GANSinAction-TheLangrBook

#### Part1
* chapter1 - Intro - theoretical stuff
* chapter2 - Generative modeling with autoencoders:
  * why we still wanna explore GANs given autoencoders almost do the job:
    * GANs have an implicit and hard-to-analyze understanding of the real data distribution. 
    * VAEs live in the directly estimated maximum likelihood model family.
* chapter3 - Generating handwritten digits using GANs
